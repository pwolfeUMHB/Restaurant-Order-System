# Restaurant Order System

## Objective
Create a comprehensive system for managing restaurant orders, including a user interface for placing orders, backend logic for processing, and database management for order tracking.

## Tools Required
- Git Bash
- Any text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
- Web server and database (e.g., XAMPP for MySQL and Apache)
- Web browser

## Instructions

### Project Initialization
1. Open Git Bash.
2. Navigate to your preferred project directory.
3. Clone the repository using `git clone git@github.com:pwolfeUMHB/Restaurant-Order-System.git`.
4. Change into the `Restaurant-Order-System` directory with `cd Restaurant-Order-System`.

### Environment Setup
1. Set up your local web server and database.
2. Create a new database named `restaurant_order_system` for the project.

### Version Control
1. Initialize a Git repository (if not already done) using `git init`.
2. Confirm the setup with `git status`.

### Create and Checkout a New Branch
1. Create a new branch for your development using `git checkout -b your_name`, replacing `your_name` with your actual name. This naming convention will help identify the contributor.

### System Development
1. Develop the frontend interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Implement backend logic with your choice of server-side technology (e.g., PHP, Node.js).
3. Integrate database operations for order tracking.

#### Specific Features to Implement
- **Menu Table:** Create a detailed table displaying the restaurant's menu items, including descriptions and prices. This table should allow customers to easily browse through the offerings.
- **Order Form:** Design a user-friendly form for customers to submit their orders. The form should include selections for menu items and input fields for personal and contact information.

### Commit to Git
1. Save your changes.
2. Add your files to the staging area with `git add .`.
3. Commit your changes with a descriptive message using `git commit -m "Develop initial order system functionality"`.

### Push Your Branch to the Remote Repository
1. Push your branch to GitHub using `git push -u origin your_name`.
2. Verify that your branch has been pushed to the remote repository by checking on GitHub.

### Testing
1. Test the system thoroughly to ensure all features work as intended.
2. Make adjustments based on feedback or identified issues during testing.

## Deliverables
- A complete system that allows for efficient order management.
- Documentation of your development process and system functionalities.

## Submission
- Push your repository to a remote service like GitHub and provide the link.
- Submit all deliverables according to your instructor's guidelines.

Good luck, and happy coding!
